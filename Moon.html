    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna, which is the main adjective for all things Moon-related: lunar.

    <h2>Phases</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>In our entire solar system, the only object that shines with its own light is the Sun. </li>
        <li>The Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side.</li>
        <li>This is as close as we come to seeing the Sunâ€™s illumination of the entire day side of the Moon (so, technically, this would be the real half moon)</li>
        <li>The Moon is nearly back to the point in its orbit where its dayside directly faces the Sun, and all that we see from our perspective is a thin curve.</li>
        <li>It travels around our planet once every 27.322 days in an elliptical orbit, an elongated circle.</li>
    </ul>
