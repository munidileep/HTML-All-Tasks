    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third largest planet in our solar system â€“ about four times wider than Earth.Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side. Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows blues to be reflected back into space.William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.

    <h2>Size and Orbit</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Uranus With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth.</li>
        <li>From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical units away from the Sun. </li>
        <li>One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once around its axis.</li>
        <li>Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).</li>
        <li>it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.</li>
    </ul>
