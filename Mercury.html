    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the nearest to the Sun. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and the smallest planet in our solar system - only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system â€“ that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.

    <h2>Surface</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter).</li>
        <li>Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called "crater rays".</li>
        <li>Temperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent shadows.</li>
