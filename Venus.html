    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system.Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, and often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer, and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks.

    <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius).</li>
        <li>At the tops of Venus clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation.</li>
        <li>The most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride.</li>
        <li>Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus atmosphere.</li>
        <li>None of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds.</li>
