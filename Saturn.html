    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with a dazzling system of icy rings, Saturn is unique among the planets. Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.

    <h2>Rings</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Saturn With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth.</li>
        <li>Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt.</li>
        <li>Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, turn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity.</li>
        <li>Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings.</li>
        <li>The rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division</li>
    </ul>
