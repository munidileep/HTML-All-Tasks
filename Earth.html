    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
        Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
        In Germanic Earth means "the ground". The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
        Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.
        Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.

    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Earth With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers).</li>
        <li>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun.</li>
        <li>That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days.</li>
        <li>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. </li>
        <li>When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</li>
    </ul>
