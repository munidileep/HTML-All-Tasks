    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Jupiter is largest planet in our solar system. If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system,Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiterâ€™s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology.

        <li>From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun.</li>
        <li>One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance</li>
        <li>It takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</li>
