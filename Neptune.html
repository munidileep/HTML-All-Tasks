    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Neptune is the eighth, and most distant planet from the Sun. It’s the fourth-largest, and the first planet discovered with math.Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun.More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye. The planet’s blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but allows blue ones to be reflected back into space – very much like its neighbor, Uranus. Neptune was the first planet located using math. German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea.

    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane</li>
        <li>The methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. </li>
        <li>Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun.</li>
        <li>Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's.</li>
        <li>Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue.</li>
