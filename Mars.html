    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and the seventh largest. It’s the only planet we know of inhabited entirely by robots.Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers – like NASA's Perseverance rover – are serving as pathfinders to eventually get humans to the surface of the Red Planet.The six-wheeled geologist found a fascinating rock that has some indications it may have hosted microbial life billions of years ago, but further research is needed.

    <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
    <ul style="font-size: larger;">
        <li>Mars With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth</li>
        <li>If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.</li>
        <li>From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. </li>
        <li>One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.</li>
        <li>From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.</li>
